# Title: Applying Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews using support vector Machine
## Description:
Sentiment Analysis has its potential applications in a wide spectrum of applications including popularity analysis and user satisfaction analysis.
We apply the sentiment analysis on the user reviews for the movies. The input data for the sentiment analysis comes from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). The movie reviews are to be converted into the feature vectors for the classifier to input. The dataset is split into training dataset and testing dataset.
In this project, we use the support vector machine, a supervised machine learning algorithm in learning the sentiment classifier and apply the classification model to predict the sentiment of the test dataset of the movie reviews.

## Scope:
We only cover two classes of sentiments in this project, i.e positive and negative. The degree of positive and negative sentiment is however not in the scope of this our project.
